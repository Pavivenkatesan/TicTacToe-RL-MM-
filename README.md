# Tic-Tac-Toe using Reinforcement Learning and MinMax algorithm

## Overview

A simple tic-tac-toe game using reinforcement learing on the bot player.
Another mode of gameplay where min-max alogorithm is also used.

## Tech Stack

* Language: Python 3.7
* Libraries: Numpy 1.16.4, Math, Itertools etc.
* Framework: Kivy 1.11.1, Toolchain.py
* IDE: PyCharm
* Compiler: Cython 0.29.10
* Build Platform: Xcode 10.3
* Build Target: iOS - iPhone 7 Plus

## Requirements and Challenges
Kivy App can be packaged into any platform like MacOS, iOS, iPadOS, Android.
So, its totally upto you to choose wherever you wanted to it to be deployed.

Specific versions needs to be followed for Kivy - Cython - Xcode to work in unison.

## Learnings
Reinforcement training can be used to train a system continuously.
A large training set with right trained module can become unbeatable and possibly be near perfect with accuracy ver 99 %.

## Future Scopes
The game is one of the simple demonstration of Reinforcement Learning. 
RL combines the functional approximation of Deep Learning with the optimization of decision-based systems to bring the next wave of technology-fueled innovation.
Future applications of reinforcement learning may include,
•	Advanced online multi-player gaming system like Google Stadia
•	Smart traffic signals
•	Autonomous robots
•	Advanced self-driving cars
•	Smart prosthetic limbs
